# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# Weather App

This is a simple weather app built with React and Vite. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and display it on the page.

The app has the following features:

- Search for a city and get the weather for that city
- Get the current location and get the weather for that location
- Display the weather for the next 24 hours
